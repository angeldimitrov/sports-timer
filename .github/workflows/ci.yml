# This workflow has been consolidated into pr-checks.yml
# to avoid duplicate test runs and conflicting results.
# 
# All test automation is now handled by:
# - pr-checks.yml: Runs on PRs (linting, type checking, unit tests, build)
# - deploy.yml: Runs on main branch (tests + deployment)

# Original CI Tests workflow disabled on 2025-08-02
# Reason: Consolidating test automation into pr-checks.yml for cleaner CI pipeline
