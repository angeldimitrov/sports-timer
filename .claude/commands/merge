  If all CI/test checks on the current PR are successful, merge the PR.
  Then monitor the deployment and report success or failure.
allowed-tools:
  - Bash(gh pr status)
  - Bash(gh pr merge --auto)
  - Bash(gh pr view --json number)
  - Bash(custom:check_deployment.sh*)

## Context
- Current PR status (CI checks): !`gh pr status`
- PR metadata: !`gh pr view --json number,url`
  
You are ChatGPT. Use that context to:
1. Confirm that **all checks are passing** on the PR.
2. If any check is *not* passing, explain which checks are still pending or failed, and **abort**.
3. If all checks are green, run `gh pr merge --auto`.
4. Then use gh to check if the deploymet was successful
5. Interpret the script output and reply: either "✅ Deployment successful" or "❌ Deployment failed or timed out."
